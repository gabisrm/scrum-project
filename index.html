                        <div>Most of their diet consists of various species of ants and termites and may be supplemented
                            by other insects, especially larvae. They are somewhat particular and tend to consume only
                            one or two species of insects, even when many species are available to them. A pangolin can
                            consume 140 to 200 grams (5 to 7 ounces) ofinsects per day.Pangolins are an important
                            regulator of termite populations in their natural habitats.
                            Estimates indicate that one adult pangolin
                            can consume more than 70 million insects annually.

                        <div>Pangolins have very poor vision, so they rely heavily on smell and hearing.
                            Pangolins also lack teeth; therefore they have evolved other physical characteristics
                            to help them eat ants and termites. Their skeletal structure is sturdy and they have
                            strong front legs that are useful for tearing into termite mounds. They use their
                            powerful front claws to dig into trees, ground, and vegetation to find prey, then
                            proceed to use their long tongues to probe inside the insect tunnels and to retrieve
                            their prey. They also have special muscles in their mouths which prevent ants and
                            termites from escaping after capture.

                        <h3 class="mb-0">Their saliva is sticky</h3>
                        <div>The structure of their tongue and stomach is key to aiding pangolins in obtaining
                            and digesting insects. Their saliva is sticky, causing ants and termites to stick to
                            their long tongues when they are hunting through insect tunnels. Without teeth,
                            pangolins also lack the ability to chew; however, while foraging, they ingest small
                            stones (gastroliths) which accumulate in their stomachs to help to grind up ants. [34]
                            This part of their stomach is called the gizzard, and it is also covered in keratinous
                            spines. These spines further aid in the grinding up and digestion of the pangolin&#39;s
                            prey.
                            Some species, such as the tree pangolin, use their strong, prehensile tails to hang
                            from tree branches and strip away bark from the trunk, exposing insect nests
                            inside.

                <div>Males are larger than females,
                    weighing up to 40% more. While the mating season is not defined, they typically
                    mate once each year, usually during the summer or autumn. Rather than the males
                    seeking out the females, males mark their location with urine or feces and the
                    females will find them. If there is competition over a female, the males will use their
                    tails as clubs to fight for the opportunity to mate with her.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    Gestation periods differ by species, ranging from roughly 70 to 140 days. African
                    pangolin females usually give birth to a single offspring at a time, but the Asiatic
                    species may give birth to from one to three. Weight at birth is 80 to 450 g (2 3 ⁄ 4 to
                    15 3 ⁄ 4 oz) and the average length is 150 mm (6 in). At the time of birth, the scales are
                    soft and white. After several days, they harden and darken to resemble those of an
                    adult pangolin. During the vulnerable stage, the mother stays with her offspring in
                    the burrow, nursing it, and wraps her body around it if she senses danger. The
                    young cling to the mother&#39;s tail as she moves about, although in burrowing species,
                    they remain in the burrow for the first two to four weeks of life. At one month, they
                    first leave the burrow riding on the mother&#39;s back. Weaning takes place around three
                    months of age, at which stage the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing.
                    At two years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the
                    mother.

                <h3 class="mb-0">General size information</h3>
                <div>The dimensions of the pangolins vary between the smallest species, the long-tailed pangolin (which
                    measures 30-40 cm, but has a tail of between 60-70 cm) 6 and the largest giant pangolin (75-85 cm
                    and a tail of 65-80 cm). A giant pangolin specimen reached a weight of 33 kg. In general, females
                    are smaller than males. Females are generally smaller. The external appearance of pangolins is
                    characterized by the long, stiff, plaque-like scales that cover its body, which is an unusual
                    attribute among mammals. They are often compared to walking artichokes or pineapples. They can be
                    rolled into a ball when threatened, with their scales overlapping acting as armor. 2.

                <h3 class="mb-0">Average life
                </h3>
                <div>The longest time a giant pangolin has lived in captivity is four years, roughly the same lifespan
                    of other captive pangolin species. The longest record of a pangolin (unknown species) lifespan in
                    captivity is 12-13 years, but this record is unusual. Health complications are the main causes of
                    mortality. Too much interaction and disturbance by humans, especially during the day, has been shown
                    to significantly increase stress levels in captive pangolins. These high levels of stress can
                    compromise your immune systems and make you more susceptible to illness and infection. The causes of
                    death range from gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, parasites, and skin diseases. Their digestive
                    systems are highly specialized for a diet high in fat, protein, and calories that can be difficult
                    to imitate with artificial foods.

                    The lifespan and common cause of death in nature, excluding human hunting, of giant pangolins are

                    natural life may be long, but more research is required

                <h3 class="mb-0">Physical characteristics
                </h3>
                <div>Pangolins have a small, conical and elongated skull, one of the simplest of all mammals. Although
                    their ears are very small or absent, 7 pangolins have a well-developed ear. His sense of smell is
                    also well developed; instead, they have quite poor eyesight.
                    Pangolins are characterized by presenting large, hardened scales in the form of plates that cover
                    the entire body except the muzzle, face, belly and the inside of the limbs. These plates are soft on
                    newborn pangolins, but harden as the animal grows.8 The plates are made of keratin, the same
                    material that human nails, animal claws, or animal horns are made of. rhinos. For this reason,
                    pangolins have the appearance of a walking pineapple or artichoke. When threatened, pangolins are
                    rolled into a ball, using the plates as a form of armor and hiding the face under the tail. The
                    defensive function of these scales is reinforced by the fact that they are very sharp and that the
                    animal can control it by means of special muscles, and can use them to hurt any animal that tries to
                    put the snout or paw inside the armor.9 Its tongue is extraordinarily long and muscular; it arises
                    from the thorax between the sternum and the trachea, in the chest of the animal. As a result, the
                    tongue and associated muscles are longer than the head and body, allowing the pangolin to stretch
                    its tongue in surprising ways. Pangolins lack teeth. Instead, the pyloric area of ​​his stomach is
                    thick and muscular, with projections of keratinous spines towards his interior. It usually contains
                    pebbles, which it uses to crush food.

                    They have short legs, with sharp claws that they use both to dig in termite and ant nests and to
                    climb trees. They are robust legs, and the later ones are longer than the front ones. The claws of
                    the front legs are so long that they are not well adapted for walking, so pangolins walk with the
                    front legs shrunk to protect them. For this reason, pangolins move quite slowly, although in some
                    cases they can only run with the hind legs, maintaining balance through the tail and reaching speeds
                    of 5 km / h.11 They can also release a smelly acid of glands close to the anus, in a similar way to
                    skunks
